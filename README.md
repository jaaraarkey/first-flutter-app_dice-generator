**Title:** Dice Generator - A Flutter Learning App

**Description:**

This is a beginner-friendly Flutter app that simulates rolling dice. It serves as a practical introduction to core Flutter and Dart concepts, making it ideal for those starting their Flutter development journey.

**Key Features:**

- Generates random dice rolls for a fun and interactive experience.
- Provides a clear visual representation of the rolled dice.
- Demonstrates essential Flutter and Dart principles:
    - `void main()`: The main entry point of your app.
    - `runApp()`: Launches the app and sets the root widget.
    - Variable types (`var`, `final`, `const`): Offer control over data mutability.
    - Type safety: Enhances code reliability and performance.
    - Widget hierarchy: Builds the user interface using widgets.
        - `StatelessWidget`: Static UI elements that don't change.
        - `StatefulWidget`: Dynamic UI components that can update.
    - Classes (public and private): Organize code structure and manage accessibility.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - Ensure you have Flutter installed following the official guide: [https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
