# first_app

My first flutter app.
Dice generator.

Iincludes most important concepts in flutter and dart:
- void main() {...} // Main app container/program function;
- runApp(...) // Should be always be first function in the main function;
- var, final, const variables;
- typezation // dart implements strong typization for a better performance and compilation;
- public classes;
- privat classes; // should be started from _underline;
- abstract interface classes;

- widget concept // In flutter every component is called widget:
    - StatelessWidget(...) // Static widget
    - StatefullWidget(...) // Dynamnic widget
